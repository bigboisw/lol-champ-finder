# LOL Champ Finder

LOL Champ Finder is an app that returns a random champ that satisfies the selected criteria. Its purpose is to help new League of Legends players pick an ideal starter they want from the overwhelmingly large pool of 166 champs.

All data is scraped directly from the LOL wiki. The source to the uncleaned CSV file can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liamsmitsdorff/league-of-legends-champion-information?resource=download).

A video demonstration of the page can be found [here](https://youtu.be/qNdl4FsTGjs).
